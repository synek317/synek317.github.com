Programming is my hobby, my job and my life. The earliest programming memory I can remember was the Atari BASIC calculator which asked for two numbers and an operator (which had to be entered as a number becauses I didn't know how to read strings from the user :)). Too bad I've lost a page from my notebook with the source code and original comments. It was around 1997 when I was about 9 years old.

I'm self-thought from the very beginning. I was given a coding book as a kid and following my dad's advice, whenever I couldn't understand something, I've just read the chapter over and over. I can't count the number of times I've read the chapter on arrays! Anyway, years ago, when the Internet hasn't been a common thing yet, learning to code was difficult. Thanks to this, I've gained the most important skill ever - independent acquisition of knowledge. My goal has always been to understand why and how things work, no matter what the language or framework I use.

I have been working at [anixe](http://anixe.pl) since 2012. We fetch there hotel's data from various sources and calculate prices for millions of possible stays. This includes dealing with multiple external systems of varying quality. What I like most is learning new data formats, analyzing discrepancies and optimizing the process. From the technical perspective, the most fascinating thing is we use [rust](http://rust-lang.org) alongside c# and ruby.

Recently, I have been thinking about changing the domain from travel & tourism to healthcare or similar. Honestly, I came to this conclusion in the first weeks of the COVID. The healthcare industry seems to process and analze tons of fascinating data. I bet there is a lot of place for improvments, optimizations and discoveries!
